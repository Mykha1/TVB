All Telegram users know that only individuals with a premium account can use the Voice-to-Text Conversion feature. 
I have solved this problem and created a Telegram bot that provides you with the same opportunity as premium users.
Upon using the "/start" command, bot greets users and provides a "What can you do?" button to access its capabilities. 
Users can also select their preferred language for voice message recognition using the /trsc command, with options such as English, Ukrainian, Russian, and Czech.



Parser
Additionally, the bot can provide current weather information in Prague.
I've also added a parser to this bot. If you use the command /weather, the bot will send you a message with temperature and weather conditions.
